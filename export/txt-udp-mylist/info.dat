Simple text format export template which emulates the output of the UDP API MYLIST command.
It's goal is to produce identical results as the actual UDP API interface and it is intended
to be used to initialize client local caches.
Note: extra information beyond what MYLIST returns is on "comment" lines beginning with #.
Note: this template is still experimental and should not yet be used by anyone except aaabbb1.
