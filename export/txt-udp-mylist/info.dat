This is a simple text format export template which emulates the output of the UDP API MYLIST
command.  It's goal is to produce identical results as the actual UDP API interface and it
is intended to be used to initialize or update client local caches.

Extra information beyond what MYLIST returns is formatted as comments beginning with # and
extending to the end of the line.  This information can be used for client parsing and error
checking and includes items such as file size and ED2K hash, so the client can identify to
which local file a particular MYLIST entry is referring.  These comments may be be discarded
as desired.

Note: this template is still experimental and should not yet be used by anyone except aaabbb1.
It currently returns formatted times which do not match the actual server values (there are
no seconds in the formatted times, only minutes, while the server stores unix style epoch
times which includes seconds).  Ommina is working on adding raw time support into the export
system, so that we can get results that will exactly match the server both in format and value.
