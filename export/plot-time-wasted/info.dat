This template will output a file containing the length of every watched file in
your mylist, as well as the date you marked the, watched. Included is a small
python-script (time-wasted.py) that you can use to transform the output to a
format suitable for plotting with gnuplot, and an even smaller shell-script
(gnuplot.sh) that, using gnuplot, generates a nice svg-image.
