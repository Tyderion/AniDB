A very simple sfv file creator useful to check the CRC of your files.
The format generated is the following:
;"Anime name"
"episode number (2 digits)" "CRC"

If there is no CRC defined, the CRC will be replace by "no_CRC".
If the file is flaged as being self-edited, the format change to "episode number (2 digits)" self-edited "CRC".
The files with the generic or deleted status are not listed.
Of course, you will have to replace the episode number by the actual names of your files before being able to check them.
