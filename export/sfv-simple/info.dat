A very simple sfv file creator usefull to check the CRC of your files.
The formate generated is the following:
;"Anime name"
"episode number (2 digits)" "CRC"

If there is no CRC defined, the CRC will be replace by "no_CRC".
Of cource, you will have to replace the episode number by the actual names of your files
before being able to use it.
