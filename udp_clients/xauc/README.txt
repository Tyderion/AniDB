ffmpeg libs need to be in your path if you plan on using the avparsing function

current used major versions are (only these major versions will work):
libavcodec: 52
libavformat: 52
libavutil: 49

for windows i've supplied a recent build (FFmpeg Revision 15986	03-12-08) from:
http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/builds/
For windows place the libs in your windows/system32 folder (for Vista find out where to put them)

for linux, well you should know what to do :P
